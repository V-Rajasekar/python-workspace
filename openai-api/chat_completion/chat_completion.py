The code sets up a chat interaction between the user and the assistant using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model.
The base_messages list contains system and user messages that set the context for the conversation.
Inside the loop, the assistant generates a response based on the combined messages (base messages + previous responses).
The assistantâ€™s response is printed, and the user can input the next message.
The loop continues until manually stopped. """
